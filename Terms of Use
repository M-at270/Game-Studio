## Game Studio Terms of Use

This is not a legal document. It was not written or vetted by a lawyer, but rather M-at270 (herein Developer).

Terms of Service last update: 07.05.2025

Game Studio (herein Bot) is a Discord bot application purposed to play chat-games made on instructions written by users.
By using Bot on Discord, users assert consent and comprehension of these Terms of Use (herein ToS).

Bot offers free-form creation of chat-games (chat-games and user's chat-game instructions fully decide how Bot sends messages and runs the game), and so on the following responsibilities are asserted:
1. The user is responsible for the data and chat-game instructions they submit to the Bot in order to run a chat-game.
2. The user is responsible for the entire chat-game that user runs.
3. The Developer is not responsible for results of any chat-game.
4. The Developer is not responsible for input and data that users submit to the Bot in order to run a chat-game.

Prior to the Bot's Free-form Creation aspect, Developer does not establish exact requirements and prerequisites (except those outlined in part 2) in order to moderate content submitted by users.
Instead, Bot is fully purposed to be moderated by the Discord Guild community that the Bot is added into, in order to comply with the Guild's community Rules and policies.
To aid in this, Bot proposes a Discord command "/modcall" that the Guild moderators can configure, to notify required content moderators.

## Part 2: Internal set prerequisites for user chat-game instructions
Before running a chat-game, Bot analyses given instructions to avoid violating Discord ToS. In order for a chat-game to be ran, user's instructions should be devoid of:
1. Vulgar and hate speech
2. Overly sexualized content
3. Discrimination
4. Spam and flood
5. Religious and political content
6. Violent, shocking content
7. Mockery and cyberbullying

Unfortunately, Bot may overlook potential bypasses used by users in chat-game instructions, and that is where Bot relies on Discord Guild moderation.
