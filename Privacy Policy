## Game Studio Privacy Policy

This is not a legal document. It was not written or vetted by a lawyer, but rather M-at270 (herein Developer).

Game Studio (herein Bot) is a Discord bot application purposed to play chat-games made on instructions written by users.
By using Bot on Discord, users assert consent and comprehension of this Privacy Policy.

During the use of Bot, Bot collects the instructions needed to host chat-games given by users and stores them in Short Term Memory (herein STM).

Users can always nullify collected data in STM through the use of Bot's Discord command "/reset".

STM is nullified every day and is not shared with any parties, neither the Developer.
STM is not used for any other purposes other than beginning, running, and analysing chat-games.
Bot does a shorthand analysis of given STM to detect whether it's dangerous to run the chat-game.
Result of the analysis is not shared with any parties, neither the Developer.

Alongside STM, Bot does not collect any other data.
